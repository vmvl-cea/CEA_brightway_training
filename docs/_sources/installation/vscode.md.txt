# Installation of VS code

VS code is a IDE, an integrated development environment. It allows you to write, run and debug code. It also has a lot of extensions to add functionnalities. For exemple, using the `jupyter` extension, you can create write, run and debug `jupyter notebooks`. Notebooks are a combination of interactive code and text in the same document, making them well suited for tutorials, tests, exploration and presentation of codes.

## Install VS code

Go to the software center and install Visual Studio Code

## Install required extensions

The extensions are located on the left sidebar.

Search for the `Python` and the `Jupyter` extensions and install them.

## VS code and environments

When you run Python code in VS code, you must specify in which environment you want the code to be executed. In other word, you need to specify which Python interpreter (`Python.exe` file) you want to read your Python code.

This can be done as on the pictures below
