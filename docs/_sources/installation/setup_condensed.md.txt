# Quickstart

> **_NOTE:_**  
> This is a summary of all the setup steps.  
> It is totally equivalent to going through the Setup pages I. to III., but without the explanations.  
> If you prefer having the explanations, please follow the pages I. to III. (since it is totally equivalent).  

1. Install **Miniforge** from CEA's software center.

2. Open a terminal and activate **Conda** commands on your computer by running:

    ```cmd
    conda init
    ```

3. Verify that Conda is well installed. The following command should just print its version number:

    ```cmd
    conda -V
    ```

4. Install **VS code** from CEA's software center. Open it when the installation is finished

5. On the left sidebar, click the 'Extensions' icon (looks like four squares).

6. Search for the official 'Python' extension from Microsoft and install it.

7. Repeat with the official Jupyter extension (also by Microsoft).

8. Download the [environment requirements file](./bw25_training.yml) and save it somewhere convenient.

9. Open a new terminal, go to the location where you saved the file (`cd` command) and run the following command:

    ```cmd
    conda create -n bw25 -f bw25_training.yml
    ```

10. Activate the environment by running the conda `activate` command:

    ```cmd
    conda activate bw25
    ```

11. Verify the installation by running the `activity-browser` command, which should open Activity-Browser.

    ```cmd
    activity-browser
    ```

12. You can then deactivate your environment by running:

    ```cmd
    conda deactivate
    ```

13. [Download the import_ecoinvent.py](import_ecoinvent.py) Python file.

14. Open VS Code, and open the `import_ecoinvent.py` file ('File' -> 'Open File', or 'ctrl + O')

15. Select the Python interpreter from your `bw25` environment:
    1. 'Ctrl + shift + P' to open the command menu
    2. Search for the command 'Python: Select Interpreter' and click on it
    3. Click 'Enter interpreter path...'
    4. Click 'Find'
    5. Browse for the `Python.exe` file in your `bw25` Python environment, and select this interpreter.

    Now you should see at the bottom right corner of VS code that the `bw25` interpreter has been selected.

16. Run the file by clicking the 'Play' button (top right corner)

    WATCH OUT: the script takes ca. 20 minutes to run. It is mandatory that you do this when connected to the CEA servers, preferably on site and not in VPN.
    You MUST have a FAST and STEADY INTERNET CONNECTION.

17. Verify in the terminal that there is no error message when the execution is finished.
