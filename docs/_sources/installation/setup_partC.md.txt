# III. Ecoinvent

Now that you have Brightway installed, you are ready to create your first project with ecoinvent. To do this, you will run a Pyton script automatically creating a new project and importing ecoinvent.

1. [Download the import_ecoinvent.py](import_ecoinvent.py) Python file.

2. Open VS Code, and open the `import_ecoinvent.py` file ('File' -> 'Open File', or 'ctrl + O')

3. Select the Python interpreter from your `bw25` environment:
   1. 'Ctrl + shift + P' to open the command menu
   2. Search for the command 'Python: Select Interpreter' and click on it
   3. Click 'Enter interpreter path...'
   4. Click 'Find'
   5. Browse for the `Python.exe` file in your `bw25` Python environment, and select this interpreter.

    Now you should see at the bottom right corner of VS code that the `bw25` interpreter has been selected.

4. Run the file by clicking the 'Play' button (top right corner)

    WATCH OUT: the script takes ca. 20 minutes to run. It is mandatory that you do this when connected to the CEA servers, preferably on site and not in VPN.
    You MUST have a FAST and STEADY INTERNET CONNECTION.

5. Verify in the terminal that there is no error message when the execution is finished.
