# CEA Brightway training

This website is a training on [Brightway 2.5](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/index.html#) made for LCA practitioners at CEA.

## What is Brightway

According to [its own documentation](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/), Brightway is an *open-source software package for life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental impact assessment written in the Python programming language*.

Its key benefits are its *ability to handle large datasets*, its *rapid and accurate LCA calculations* and its capacity to *go beyond conventional LCA*.
Brightway is *especially attractive for researchers, especially when used with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)*.

## What you will learn

Here you will learn how to:

* Install Brightway in a dedicated Python environment
* Use Brightway 2.5 through the graphical user-interface [Activity-Browser](https://lca-activitybrowser.github.io/activity-browser/)
* Use Brightway 2.5 directly in Python (here in a Jupyter notebook)
* Import and use complementary libraries extending Brightway's capabilities such as [lca algebraic](https://lca-algebraic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
